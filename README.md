# 20 11 23 JS Intro Practice
Completed exercises 1 - 3 in order, each exercise will build on it's self. Once 1 - 3 are complete attempt each bonus. Add comments above each exercise solution (at minimum). When grading this assignment I will only run code that is not commented out. If you have partially functioning code comment it out and provide some context of what wasn't working so I can provide feedback.
